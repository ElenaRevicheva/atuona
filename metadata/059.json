What would you tell it now?\"\n\"Crushing a dead cigarette into the ashtray, you often speak of the exhaustion of someone who's had too much. From some damned wise perspective, you could tell the night that not everything has lost its meaning yet, but...\" Ule didn't let her finish, deftly picking up the monologue.\n\"But despite all the ambitions still alive in you, you're tired. So fucking tired. Whether you're 34 or goddamn 47. Doesn't matter. And as soon as you start pouring all this out, the sleepy clouds don't want to fucking listen, they cover the moon, and the ocean of this breathing celestial night becomes even more boundless, overflowing all your edges. And Nobody up there hears you anymore. That's the bitch of it, this cheerless theme.\"\nKira continued: \"You call out to the night air, to the jasmine scent mixed with wet earth after rain, to the stars, to those same clouds blanketing their naked bodies. But you call without answer. And you smoke, and smoke again, blowing smoke until your head pounds, trying to understand where you stumbled so badly that you turned into a living corpse at 34. Because if at 34 you didn't turn out right, if the pancake came out lumpy, it means you couldn't find the right key. Transcendent or immanent – you smoke it all away until dawn, maybe you just mixed flies with meatballs and the system crashed? There's no child who, after breaking a toy, wouldn't want a new one.\"\nUle's bold gaze turned slightly downcast. He wasn't wrong to expect that this night, in which they found themselves trapped by tropical rain, wouldn't pass in silence for either of them. They both had broken the terms of their contract. They'd forgotten about the Pastorales, about Gauguin's search for Paradise on Earth, about the lots at the upcoming auction. Kira sat in the armchair, legs tucked up in her Jungle Dress, her wavy blue-black hair cascading loose. The necklace lay on the table beside her in a semicircle, inside which she'd placed a glass of whiskey on ice, barely touched. Kira tried to avoid alcohol. In 34 years she'd graduated from that school, the memory carved deep of when she disgusted herself. And now she sat before this bastard Angel, throwing him into heat with her renounced, weary sexuality, unashamed. Ule barely restrained himself from tearing off his faded blue Galliano jeans and ripping that damned dress from her, from taking this strong, sensitive, most beautiful woman in the world by force, this Ideal woman with J.Lo's figure, Kilian's \"Vodka on the Rocks\" scent, and eyes that knew how to be silent, how to speak, how to listen, how to understand, how to burn through, melt and cool. \"Her eyes are both the tile and the master's creation,\" he thought. \"I've searched for them all my life. I'd buy them from her for my collection. Oh yes, I made the right choice. Here in Atuona, she'll create my New Pastorales.\" Everything in Ule's head made him seem constrained. She didn't care. And tonight it wasn't about her sexual preferences. The hours spent at Gauguin's grave had played their part. She felt she could find His masterpiece. She just had to try very, very hard."
