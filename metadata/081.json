No rollback.\nRemember how Monet painted Rouen Cathedral again and again — not chasing form, but light?\nFashion week is that same cathedral.\nOne girl,\nseen under shifting light: Prada, Bottega, Saint Laurent.\nThe body remains.\nThe light changes.\nEach show is a new merge request.\nNot to fashion. To the opposite."
