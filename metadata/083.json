We're having dinner at the restaurant, discussing a color Renoir probably never saw — ultramarine of a tropical night.\n\nMila kicked off her shoes and sits barefoot on the sofa by the table, in white Zimmermann, like a ghost from Resort 2019 collection. I watch her bare feet — white as the dress, like she's never known sun.\n\nOle pours her Perrier with lime, and I think Renoir really never saw this color — the color of absence, color of a woman who exists only as reflection of someone else's desire.\n\nSomewhere beyond the window the ocean breathes ultramarine that wasn't on the impressionists' palette — too expensive, too pure, undiluted by turpentine.\n\n— Gustav's collection isn't about art, — Mila smooths an invisible wrinkle on the Zimmermann, and I see Ole's jaw tighten almost imperceptibly. — It's about power. Owning what no one else can buy.\n\nMila looks at Ole and Jean with that particular smile that has a price — the price of silence about where the money comes from.\n\nThe conversation drips with strained politeness.\nTwo billionaires.\nTwo owners of exclusive stuff.\n\nBerthe Morisot painted her women differently — not as objects for contemplation, but as beings with inner light that can't be bought. \"I don't think any man would ever treat a woman as his equal,\" — she said once.\n\nAnd now, watching Mila in her flawless Zimmermann, I understand: some women choose inequality themselves, like the most expensive of their Hermès bags.\n\nOle is silent, but I see the vein pulsing at his temple — the one that always betrays his rage, hidden under Norwegian politeness.\n\nJean finally speaks:\n\n— Ole, let's get to why I'm here. You're so sure about this location? You think Atuona is the right place? Besides, Pastorales — it's not an auction house in the standard sense. It's blockchain architecture, am I understanding correctly? Why did we all need to come here?\n\nOle leans back in his chair — movement of a predator who knows the prey is already trapped.\n\n— Gauguin didn't die here by accident, Jean. He sought paradise and found death — perfect metaphor for art that will outlive us all.\n\nHis fingers drum on the table the same rhythm I heard on the plane: four beats, pause — precise and filigree heartbeat.\n\n— Pastorales is consensus between those who understand: immortality costs exactly what you're willing to pay for someone else's agony.\n\nThe air between them thickens.\n\nI pull out my phone — gesture of desperation masquerading as professionalism — and find the lines I memorized on the plane.\n\n— \"Dans l'Atuona qui se meurt...\"\n\nMy voice shakes. Mila winces at my fake French like it's cheap perfume.\n\nJean freezes.\n\nBut I think I hit a nerve..."
